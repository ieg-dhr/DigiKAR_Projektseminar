<h2>Mobility of the elites of the Electorate of Mainz</h2>

<p>- this was the topic of our seminar in the summer semester of 2022 with the aim of constructing our own maps on a topic of regional history. 
The theoretical starting point was formed by recent research that postulated that it would not do justice to the Old Empire to understand it geographically and 
politically only against the background of political maps with their clear territorial boundaries within which the early modern state had developed.</p> 

<p>This position may correspond to historical reality, but it narrows the view of the far more complex political-territorial nature of the empire: 
The superordinate political structure, the Imperial Diet, was mirrored and further differentiated in the individual territories by provincial and district assemblies, 
in addition to immediate imperial cities and imperial estates. The knighthood organized itself into knightly circles, a separate subdivision of the imperial knighthood. 
The spiritual and temporal power of the bishops often diverged territorially in that in one city they were the supreme lord in political as well as religious matters, 
in others only the supreme shepherd, not the supreme temporal lord. Some executive powers were exercised by the imperial districts, which in turn were territorially 
divided according to their own organizational principles. In jurisdiction, the Reichshofrat and the Reichskammergericht competed at the highest level, and decisions 
in the area of religion could be made from 1653 onward at the level of the empire only in accordance with the two confessional corpora to which the subjects could 
appeal.</p>

<p>In practice, all this led to a close interplay of the various political-geographical order variables: Example: If Lutheran peasants complained about the policies of the Catholic sovereign, since the latter was oppressing them in their faith, they could appeal to the Corpus Evangelicorum for a remedy to the injustice. A local problem of subjects with their sovereign could thus involve the highest religious-political authority on the imperial level, or in other words: everything was connected with everything else. This breaking up of rigid thinking in fixed boundaries is accompanied by the second theoretical concept: mobility. It is especially true for elites that they did not move only within the boundaries of a territory, but had a high degree of mobility to study, to act, to hold an office, etc., and their life histories show how much they moved between boundaries and structures.
This can be seen in the example of the cathedral provosts of Mainz, on whom the seminar focused because of the comparatively favorable source and literature situation.</p> 

<p>Important stations in the lives of the 14 noble men who held the office of cathedral provost in Mainz between 1652 and 1827 were examined in detail. 
The criterion for a station in life was that it had to have a lasting influence on the respective life, so that, for example, study visits, cavalier tours, 
elevations to the cathedral chapters and secular and ecclesiastical offices were researched. The latter played a special role, since many of the gentlemen became 
members not only of Mainz, but of many other cathedral chapters, and in the course of this were elected cathedral cantors, cathedral scholasters, cathedral deans, etc.; 
some even rose to the office of bishop. Because of this focus on ecclesiastical offices, the exact dates of the beginning and end of their activity were given 
separately for each of these; for most secular offices or studies, the length of activity was taken into account, each of which was recorded as an event with a 
start and end date. The stations in the lives of the canons show that they would not only have moved within the boundaries of the Mainz diocese or in Kurmainz, 
but were also members of many other cathedral chapters and were active in the Perpetual Diet, depending on family background and personal skills, but also health and 
coincidences. Their cross-border mobility dynamizes the Old Empire and runs counter to any notion of a rigid empire that could be depicted in a few maps with 
clear boundaries; the cathedral provosts of Mainz exemplify on a small scale what (probably) applied to all elites of the Roman-German Empire.</p>
