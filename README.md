# DigiKAR_Projektseminar

This repository contains data and visualisations of early modern clerical biographies. The data were collected by students of history at Mainz University as part of an MA seminar in the summer term of 2022.

<img scr="https://github.com/ieg-dhr/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/blob/main/Logos_DigiKAR/DigiKAR_logo-small.png" width="100px"/> The student project is affiliated with the DigiKAR geohumanities project which aims to experimentally visualise spatial relations and mobility in the early modern Holy Roman Empire.
