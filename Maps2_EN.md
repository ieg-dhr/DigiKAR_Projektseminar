<h4>Comparative mapping of biographies</h4>

<p><em>One approach to comparatively map data is to visualise categorised or rule-based colouring of point geometries.</em></p>

<p padding="10px">The map shown here displays biographically relevant places for each cathedral provost in a different colour. While some clerics were comparatively mobile and studied far from Mainz, went on the <em>grand tour</em> or took on diplomatic missions, others' lives centred on the Electorate of Mainz or even the city of Mainz.</p>
<p padding="10px">One example of a more mobile cleric in the analysed data set is Dietich Kaspar von Fürstenberg who spent time in Florence and Rome as well as serveral places in present-day Belgium and France.</p>
