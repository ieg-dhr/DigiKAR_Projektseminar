<h2>Map 1: Places of swearing-in</h2>

<p>Map 1 shows the locations of all cathedral chapters, collegiate chapters, etc., where the 14 different canons were sworn up during their lives. In contrast to map 2, the empire is shown here in its entirety and not in sections, since the absence of swearings in the north and south of the empire is relevant and must therefore be made visible. The size of the dots stands for the frequency of the upsurges that took place in a place, i.e. a larger dot means that particularly many upsurges took place in a place, while a smaller dot means that not so many upsurges took place in a place.</p>

<h2>Map 2: Places of swearing-in (alternative view)</h2>
 
<p>Map 2 is virtually identical to Map 1, although here it is zoomed in, i.e. a smaller section is shown. This is done for practical reasons - by zooming in closer, the different point sizes become clearer. For a comprehensive interpretation of the survey results, both maps should be used together, or map 1 should be made available on the website as interactive and zoomable.</p>

<h2>Maps 3_x: Canons_number of ecclesiastical offices and places and functions</h2>

<p>The maps all show, respectively, the places and the number of clerical offices and dignities held there by an individual canon during his lifetime. Such a map was created for each canon individually. 
A visually more beautiful solution than this is a "print layout" created exemplarily for Marquard Schenk von Kastell, i.e. a map with legend and scale, which is, however, very time-consuming in its creation and could therefore only be made exemplarily for one canon.</p>
