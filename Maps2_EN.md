<h2>Comparative mapping of biographies</h2>

<p><em>One approach to comparatively map data is to visualise categorised or rule-based colouring of point geometries.</em></p>

<p padding="10px">The map shown here displays biographically relevant places for each cathedral provost in a different colour. While some clerics were comparatively mobile and studied far from Mainz, went on the <em>grand tour</em> or took on diplomatic missions, others' lives centred on the Electorate of Mainz or even the city of Mainz.</p>
<p padding="10px">One example of a more mobile cleric in the analysed data set is Dietich Kaspar von Fürstenberg who spent time in Florence and Rome as well as serveral places in present-day Belgium and France.</p>

<h2>Maps 3_x: Canons_number of ecclesiastical offices and places and functions</h2>

<p>The maps all show, respectively, the places and the number of clerical offices and dignities held there by an individual canon during his lifetime. Such a map was created for each canon individually. 
A visually more beautiful solution than this is a "print layout" created exemplarily for Marquard Schenk von Kastell, i.e. a map with legend and scale, which is, however, very time-consuming in its creation and could therefore only be made exemplarily for one canon.</p>
