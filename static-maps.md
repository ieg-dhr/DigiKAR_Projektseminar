<hr2><strong>Static maps highlighting alternative data aspects</strong></hr2>

As part of the seminar at JGU Mainz, the participating students were asked to create several static maps highlighting alternative data aspects:

<em>1) One approach was to visualise event times using the colouring of point geometries.</em>

<em>2) Another approach was to connect events in one person's biography with straight lines to highlight individual mobility. One QGIS-plug-in that helps with converting point geometries to line geometries is <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pointstopaths_v02/">PointsToPaths</a>, an application developed for wildlife tracking.</em>

<em>3) The third visualisation option used <em>point clustering</em> to show the overall density of biographic events in the mapped places.</em>
