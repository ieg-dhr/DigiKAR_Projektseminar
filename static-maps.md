<hr2><strong>Static maps highlighting alternative data aspects</strong></hr2>

As part of the seminar at JGU Mainz, the participating students were asked to create several static maps highlighting alternative data aspects:

1) One approach was to visualise event times using the colouring of point geometries.

2) Another approach was to connect events in one person's biography with straight lines to highlight individual mobility.

3) The third visualisation option used <em>point clustering</em> to show the overall density of biographic events in the mapped places.
