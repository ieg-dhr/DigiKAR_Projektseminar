<h2>Static maps highlighting several biographies</h2>

<h4>1) Comparative mapping of biographies</h4>

<p><em>One approach to comparatively map data is to visualise categorised or rule-based colouring of point geometries.</em></p>

<p padding="10px">The map shown here displays biographically relevant places for each cathedral provost in a different colour. While some clerics were comparatively mobile and studied far from Mainz, went on the <em>grand tour</em> or took on diplomatic missions, others' lives centred on the Electorate of Mainz or even the city of Mainz.</p>
<p padding="10px">One example of a more mobile cleric in the analysed data set is Dietich Kaspar von Fürstenberg who spent time in Florence and Rome as well as serveral places in present-day Belgium and France.</p>

<h4>3) Point clustering to show centres of action</h4>
<em>An alternative visualisation is <em>point clustering</em> to show the overall density of biographic events in the mapped places.</em>

<p>The map above shows places in the collected dataset as coloured clusters. The largest dots indicate place names that are disproportionately frequent in the data.</p>
<p>The map below shows numerical frequencies per cluster. In exact numbers, the cathedral of Mainz (Dom Mainz) is the most frequent place with 65 occurrences. 22 places mapped as "Germany" in the centre of the present-day German Federal Republic denote biographic events for which the sources did not provide specific spatial information.</p>

<p>All geocoded places with 5 and more occurrences are listed in the table below. Spatial information in the original sources were mapped to these modern places to permit an automated geo-coding. As demonstrated in the point-cluster map above, unclear places (especially places of birth) were summarily mapped to "Germany" to include the events linked with them in visual representations at all. Therefore, the maps created in the project require contextualisation and a critical user engagement.</p>
