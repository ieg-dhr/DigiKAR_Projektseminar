<p>Map 1 shows the locations of all cathedral chapters, collegiate chapters, etc., where the 14 different canons were sworn up during their lives. In contrast to map 2, the empire is shown here in its entirety and not in sections, since the absence of swearings in the north and south of the empire is relevant and must therefore be made visible. The size of the dots stands for the frequency of the upsurges that took place in a place, i.e. a larger dot means that particularly many upsurges took place in a place, while a smaller dot means that not so many upsurges took place in a place.</p>

<p>Map 2 is virtually identical to Map 1, although here it is zoomed in, i.e. a smaller section is shown. This is done for practical reasons - by zooming in closer, the different point sizes become clearer. For a comprehensive interpretation of the survey results, both maps should be used together, or map 1 should be made available on the website as interactive and zoomable.</p>
