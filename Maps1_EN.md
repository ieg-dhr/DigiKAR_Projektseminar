<h4>Swearings-in (frequencies)</h4>

<p align="justify">The map shows the locations of all cathedral chapters and collegiate chapters where the cathedral provosts of the Mainz cathedral 
chapter were sworn in during their lives. The size of the dots symbolizes the frequency of the swearings in each place. While the number of swearings 
in a place together with the color highlights the places with several swearings, the dots without number stand for a swearing in of a single cathedral provost.</p>

<p align="justify">The <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/information_EN.html">fourteen cathedral provosts</a> who were elected as cathedral provosts in the Mainz cathedral chapter between 1650 and 1817 were considered. In addition to the cathedral chapters in Mainz, Trier, Speyer, Bamberg, Worms, Würzburg, Eichsstätt, Hildesheim and Minden, the map depicts the swearing-in 
of individual cathedral provosts in various other monasteries. The map shows various swearing-in ceremonies in the area between Brunswick and Hanover in the 
north and Ingolstadt in the south, since none of the selected cathedral provosts was sworn in at chapters further south. The families of the 
cathedral provosts predominantly held the rank of imperial knights, which could be the reason for the low number of swearings-in at the cathedral chapter of 
Cologne and the lack of swearings-in in Strasbourg, where the rank of imperial count was a prerequisite for access.</p>

<p>The source and literature basis for research on the lives of the individual cathedral provosts varies considerably, but the places of swearings-in have been quite reliably handed down. The resources used for our research can be found in <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/sources_EN">list of primary sources and research literature</a>.</p>

<h4>Alternative mapping of places of all swearings-in</h4>

<img src="./maps/Domherren_Aufschwörungsorte_Ausschnitt Deutschland.png" width="650px" align="center"/>

<p align="justify">An alternative way of visualising the swearing-in is presented in this map of present-day Germany and neighbouring regions which shows the locations of all cathedral chapters, collegiate chapters, etc., where the 14 different canons were sworn in during their lives. In contrast to the close-up map below, the early modern Empire is shown in its entirety since the absence of swearings-in in the northern and southern regions is relevant and must therefore be made visible. The size of the dots stands for the frequency of the swearings-in that took place per city, i.e. a larger dot means that particularly many swearings-in have been recorded, while a smaller dot means that not so many events could be traced in a place.</p>

<p align="justify">The close-up map is virtually identical to map above but zoomed in so that a smaller region is shown. This is done for practical reasons - by zooming in, the different point sizes become clearer. For a comprehensive interpretation of the research results, all maps should be used comparatively.</p>
