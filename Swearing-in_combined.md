<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The map shows the locations of all cathedral chapters and collegiate chapters where the cathedral provosts of the Mainz cathedral 
chapter were sworn in during their lives. The size of the dots symbolizes the frequency of the swearings in each place. While the number of swearings 
in a place together with the color highlights the places with several swearings, the dots without number stand for a swearing in of a single cathedral provost.</p>

<p>The fourteen cathedral provosts who were elected as cathedral provosts in the Mainz cathedral chapter between 1650 and 1817 were considered:</p> 

 <ul>
  <li>Adolf Hund von Saulheim (1652-1668)</li>
  <li>Johann von Heppenheim genannt von Saal (1668-1672)</li>
  <li>Lothar Friedrich von Metternich-Burscheid (1672-1673)</li>
  <li>Dietrich Kaspae von Fürstenberg (1673-1675)</li>
  <li>Markwart Schenk von Kastell (1675-1685)</li>
  <li>Johann Wilhelm Wolff-Metternich von der Gracht (1685-1694)</li>
  <li>Christoph Rudolf von Stadion (1695-1700)</li>
  <li>Heinrich Ferdinand von der Leyen (1700-1714)</li>
  <li>Johann Philipp Franz Graf von Schönborn (1714-1724)</li>
  <li>Hugo Wolfgang von Kesselstadt (1724-1738)</li>
  <li>Karl Emmerich von Breitbach-Bürresheim (1738-1743)</li>
  <li>Hugo Franz Karl von Eltz (1743-1779)</li>
  <li>Heinrich Wilhelm Harff von Dreyborn (1779-1781)</li>
  <li>Damian Friedrich Graf von der Leyen (1781-1817)</li>
</ul> 

<p>In addition to the cathedral chapters in Mainz, Trier, Speyer, Bamberg, Worms, Würzburg, Eichsstätt, Hildesheim and Minden, the map depicts the swearing-in 
of individual cathedral provosts in various other monasteries. The map shows various swearing-in ceremonies in the area between Brunswick and Hanover in the 
north and Ingolstadt in the south, since none of the selected cathedral provosts was sworn in in the chapters further south in Germany. The families of the 
cathedral provosts were predominantly from the rank of imperial knights, which could be the reason for the low number of swearings in the cathedral chapter of 
Cologne and the lack of swearings in Strasbourg, where the rank of imperial count was a prerequisite for access.</p>

<p>The source and literature basis for the lives of the individual cathedral provosts is highly variable, but the places of revolt are quite reliably handed down. 
The individual titles can be taken from the source and literature title.</p>
