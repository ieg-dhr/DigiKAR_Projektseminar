<h2>Mobility of elites in the Electorate of Mainz</h2>

<p>- this was the topic of our seminar in the summer term of 2022 whose aim was creating our own maps on a topic of regional history. 
The theoretical starting point was formed by recent research that postulated that it would not do justice to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> to understand it geographically and 
politically only against the background of (traditional) political maps with their clear territorial boundaries within which the early modern state had developed.</p> 

<p>This position may correspond to historical reality, but it narrows the view of the far more complex political-territorial nature of the empire. 
The superordinate political structure, the Imperial Diet, was mirrored and further differentiated in the individual territories by provincial and district assemblies, 
in addition to immediate imperial cities and imperial estates. The knighthood organized itself into knightly circles, a separate subdivision of the imperial knighthood. 
The spiritual and temporal power of the bishops often diverged territorially in that in one city they were the supreme lord in political as well as religious matters, 
in others only the supreme shepherd, not the supreme temporal lord. Some executive powers were exercised by the imperial districts, which in turn were territorially 
divided according to their own organizational principles. In jurisdiction, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulic_Council">Reichshofrat</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskammergericht">Reichskammergericht</a> competed at the highest level, and decisions 
in the area of religion could be made from 1653 onward at the level of the empire only in accordance with the two confessional corpora to which the subjects could 
appeal.</p>

<p>In practice, all this led to a close interplay of the various political-geographical order variables. <em>Example:</em> If Lutheran peasants complained about the policies of the Catholic sovereign, since the latter was oppressing them in their faith, they could appeal to the <em>Corpus Evangelicorum</em> (or Protestant league) for a remedy to the injustice. A local problem of subjects with their sovereign could thus involve the highest religious-political authority on the imperial level, or in other words: everything was connected with everything else. Breaking up the analytical rigidity of fixed boundaries is accompanied by the second theoretical concept: mobility. It is especially true for elites that they did not move only within the boundaries of a territory, but had a high degree of mobility to study, to act, to hold an office, etc., and their life histories show how much they moved between boundaries and structures.
This can be seen in the example of the cathedral provosts of Mainz, on whom the seminar focused because of the comparatively favorable source and literature situation.</p> 

<p>Important stations in the lives of <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/information_EN.html">14 noblemen</a> who held the office of cathedral provost in Mainz between 1652 and 1827 were examined in detail. 
The criterion for a station in life was that it had to have a lasting influence on the respective life, so that, for example, study visits, cavalier tours, 
elevations to the cathedral chapters and secular and ecclesiastical offices were researched. The latter played a special role, since many of the gentlemen became 
members not only of Mainz, but of many other cathedral chapters, and in the course of this were elected cathedral cantors, cathedral scholasters, cathedral deans, etc.; 
some even rose to the office of bishop. Because of this focus on ecclesiastical offices, the exact dates of the beginning and end of their activity were given 
separately for each of these; for most secular offices or studies, the length of activity was taken into account, each of which was recorded as an event with a 
start and end date. The stations in the lives of the canons show that they would not only have moved within the boundaries of the Mainz diocese or in Kurmainz, 
but were also members of many other cathedral chapters and were active in the Perpetual Diet, depending on family background and personal skills, but also health and coincidences. Their cross-border mobility dynamizes the Old Empire and runs counter to any notion of a rigid empire that could be depicted in a few maps with 
clear boundaries; the cathedral provosts of Mainz exemplify on a small scale what (probably) applied to all elites of the Roman-German Empire.</p>

<p>A favorable source situation is, of course, always to be understood only in relation to the Middle Ages: For the research work on the cathedral bishops was also a lengthy process, during which new insights could be gained again and again, but also questions and problems arose that had to be answered and solved. Literature on the individual cathedral chapters and dioceses, bishop biographies, collections of inscriptions, university lists of matrices, etc. were consulted. Even beyond that, own source work took place, for example by examining the Mainz state calendars or by making inquiries to archives. Nevertheless, for some events only approximate dates could be determined, for some events only the date and type of event could be identified, not the location; sometimes only a terminus post quem or ante quem could be determined. When several dates were available for an event, decisions were made by carefully weighing the quantity and quality of the data in the literature, unless it was possible from the outset to decide cases of doubt by researching sources and archives on one's own.</p>

<p>Following the research work, we created an <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/interactive-map_EN.html">interactive map</a> as well as several <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR_Projektseminar/static-maps_DE.html">static maps</a> highlighting different data aspects. For the sake of comprehension, the maps are each provided with a short description that briefly explains the epistemic interest, the represented provosts, and the most important graphic symbols used.</p>
