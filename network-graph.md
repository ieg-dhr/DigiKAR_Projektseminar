hr2><strong>Displaying connections between people and places in a network graph</strong></hr2>

<p align="justify">The browser-based visualisation tool <a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">Palladio</a>, provided by Stanford University, could be used to experiment with interactive maps, timelines and network graphs. In order to show the connections between people and places, person names need to be selected as <code>source</code> and mapped to place names as <code>target</code>. In the screenshot, the size of the place dots depends on the frequency of the place names in the input data.</p>
