<h2>Displaying connections between people, places and institutions in a network graph</h2>

<p align="justify">The browser-based visualisation tool <a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">Palladio</a>, provided by Stanford University, could be used to experiment with interactive maps, timelines and network graphs. In order to show the connections between people and places, person names need to be selected as <code>source</code> and mapped to place names as <code>target</code>. In the screenshot, the size of the place dots depends on the frequency of the place names in the input data.</p>

<p align="justify">Similarly, person names can be linked with institution names from the same CSV table to highlight professional networks that the analysed clerics may have shared.</p>
